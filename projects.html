                <h3>NYC Urban Forestry Air Quality Analysis</h3>
                <h4>Data Analyst in Python | Boston, MA | Sept 2024 – Dec 2024</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Led a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between urban tree distribution and air quality across NYC using 2015 Street Tree Census and pollution datasets.</li>
                    <li>Built a full data processing pipeline with cleaning, feature engineering, and geographic integration of over 666,000 tree records and multi-source pollution data.</li>
                    <li>Developed interactive Flask web apps for heatmap visualizations and data exploration, supporting analysis of pollutant patterns and tree health across boroughs.</li>
                    <li>Discovered significant correlations between tree size and reduced PM2.5 levels, with trees ≥60 inches diameter linked to 30% lower pollution—supporting policy recommendations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> Python, Flask, Pandas</p>

                <h3>Probabilistic AI Agent for Battleship</h3>
                <h4>Game Logistics with Java | Jan 2024 – May 2024</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developed a probabilistic AI agent that generates and dynamically updates a heat map of ship placement probabilities based on the remaining enemy ships and the current game state.</li>
                    <li>Implemented strategic move selection algorithms that consider adjacent squares, cardinal directions, and previous move outcomes to prioritize high-probability target coordinates.</li>
                    <li>Created an adaptive learning system that reasons about different ship configurations, adjusting probabilities and weights accordingly while efficiently exploring the board.</li>
                </ul>
